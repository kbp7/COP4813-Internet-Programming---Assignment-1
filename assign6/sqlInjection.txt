SQL Injection is an attack wherein a user submits data in a form in order to tamper with the SQL
statements that are executed. By entering special characters such as ')' an attacker can trick
server side scripts into executing the user's own scripts in the form of the data submitted.

This can be prevented by filtering user input and disallowing certain characters or using
parameterized queries, which prevent the structure of the query from ever changing.
