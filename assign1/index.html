      I am a Computing and Information Sciences major at UNF, graduating in December 2017. I was born in the Philippines and have lived in Orange Park since 2000. I love video games, superhero movies, Lana Del Rey, and anything with shrimp in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work at System Innovators in Jacksonville as a QA Analyst Intern, hoping to go into software development. Like a lot of people in this major, I started coding with C and Java. I've learned a fair amount of C#, html, and CSS on my own and I
      hope to learn a lot more this year. These pages are adapted from a personal project I did a few months ago with almost the same criteria, so that was convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically I didn't need this class to graduate but I was curious about front-end development. The visual aspects of designing web pages are really intriguing to me and it's satisfying to create something beautiful. I've always been drawn to art and
      feel like front-end development will be a fun career option to explore.

      I use Reddit every day for basically all my interests and watch Youtube videos from my favorite channels. Like every computing major, Stack Overflow has saved my butt countless times.
